## Background

This is a plotting tool that can be used to display air quality data for the city of New York during the spring/summer of 1973.  The application allows the user to pick a precise time period and desired physical quantity to display, and the display is rendered in plotly.

## Usage

Use the pull-down menus for "Start Date" and "End Date" to select the time interval over which you want to plot the data and then another pull-down menu to choose the physical quantity.  Once everything is done, click the "Proceed" checkbox to render the plot.
